# WebDev-function-arguments

Functions are extremly powerful tools that you will use ALL the time! We've only just begun to explore all that they can do. Today, we're going to focus on another aspect of functions called arguments. 

Function arguments allow us to write code that can work dynamically. This is a very good thing for many reasons. We'll be getting into those reasons a little later. For now, just focus on how arguments work. *HINT: Think of arguments as variables...*

Begin by studying the two .png files in this repo: function-definition and function-invocation. They should give you all the information you need to begin working on the exercises.

Fork this repo, clone it, and begin... :)
